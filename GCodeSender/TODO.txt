To Do for 2.0.1.1

HOTKEY DEFINING FOR FOLLOWING ACTIONS:

[X] Emergency Stop (Keep default ESC but allow to choose another key as well)
[ ] Normal stop of program.
[ ] Spindle Increase & Decrease (by set increments in settings - check if spindle option is enabled in firmaware).
[ ] Feed Rate Increase & Decrease (by set increments in settings) - Should only be adjustable during running a file.
[ ] Jog Rate Increase & Decrease (by set increments in settings) - Should only be adjustable if machine is idle.
[X] Origin Point (Return to Zero).
[ ] Single Step? (Maybe) - Press once changes step to 1 - push again reverts back to original step size.
[ ] Re-Do (Reload file for doing the same job again).
[ ] Spindle On/Off (if Enabled in firmware).
[ ] Mist On/Off (if enabled in firmware).
[X] Cycle Start (Start running of program).
[X] Cancel Manual Jogging
[X] X, Y Z Pos & Neg.

Need to find a proper stop procedure to stop file transfer instead of soft reseting.  

MAYBE: Jogging Keys: Does not move until Key Up, Maybe change to KeyDown so can click and hold

TODO: Suppliment
- Add check on Hotkeys, display error if a duplicate is currently assigned.  Display duplicate command name (maybe clear the duplicate box so they can issue another keybind)
- Add option to clear hotkey text box so it is blank/no hotkey set for that fucntion

TODO:  Soft Reset or Full Hard reset when Emergency button clicked.
